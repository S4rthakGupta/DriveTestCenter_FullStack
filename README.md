# DriveTestCenter_FullStack
 This is the final project which was done in 4 parts and is for my university.

 Please type in the command to download all the necessary packages to execute the application.
- npm install to download all the node modules and then enter
- node .\app.js

If you don't want to start the server again and again and want the application to start automatically then use this command below.
- nodemon .\app.js

- Change the PORT number in case if you need to.
- Change the connection string for the MongoDB to see the information in your own Database.

Thank You.
